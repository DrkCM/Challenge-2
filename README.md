# Challenge-2

This is the Challenge foe 2nd week...

In this homework I have build the main structure of the website in HTML and I have created a CSS to configurate the size, colour, images...

The web has been divided in a main header where the title goes,
there are one subdivion with background logo and a small slogan,
the body has 3 parts, "About Me" with personal information and hobbies, "work" wjere I show part of this hobbies, and "Contact Me" whit information like mail and phone number and 3 links to social media websites.

I used what I learned this week to create the structure of the web and how to assign the images within and distribute them throughout the defined space.

I took the liberty of modifying the information provided, such as images and texts to create something more in line with my personality.
